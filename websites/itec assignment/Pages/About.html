        <h1>About Brandon Donovan Davies</h1>
        <p>I was born on the 27th of August 1995. I have great passion for aircraft and IT related topics where i was building and playing with computers from a young age I then went on to acquire my Aircraft Avionician Trade through Denel Aviation, this taught me a great deal about aircrafts and the way they function.With the trade i have advanced my past knowledge of electronics and micro controllers. I am currently on track to acquire my Bachalor of Science Degree in Information Technology and i am currently in my third year of the course. This information i have obtained during the degree has helped me to develop and shape this current website.</p>
